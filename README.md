# Age-Salary-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

## ABSTRACT
Predicting an individual's salary based on their age is a common task in various fields, including human resources, economics, and social sciences. Machine learning offers powerful tools to build predictive models for this purpose. This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict salary based on age, exploring the relationship between these two variables and assessing the accuracy and performance of different algorithms.

## Overview

Understanding the relationship between age and salary provides valuable insights into career progression, income inequality, and economic trends.  While numerous factors influence salary, age often serves as a significant indicator, reflecting experience and career advancement. This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to build predictive models that estimate salary based on age.  We will analyze the data, train various regression models, and evaluate their performance to determine the most effective approach for this prediction task.

## Project goals

The primary goal of this project is to develop and compare different machine learning models for predicting salary based on age.  This involves:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Obtaining a relevant dataset and preparing it for model training, handling missing values and outliers.
2. **Model Development:** Building and training several regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest Regression).
3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of each model using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared).
4. **Model Selection:** Identifying the best-performing model based on the evaluation metrics.
5. **Interpretation and Analysis:** Analyzing the results and interpreting the relationship between age and salary as revealed by the model.
